\begin{slide}[Newton's method]
	Assume have a function $f(x)$ which is atleast twice differentiable at a point $x_k$. Let $q$ be function which is approximation of $f$ that agrees with it till second derivative.
	\begin{align*}
	q(x) &= \explain{f(x_k) + f'(x_k)(x-x_k) + {1\over 2} f''(x_k)(x-x_k)^2}{\text{From taylor series expansion}}
	\\
	\left.{\partial q(x) \over \partial x}\right|_{x=x^*} &= f'(x_k) + (x^*-x_k)f''(x_k) = 0
	\qquad\min q(x) \implies \partial q(x) = 0
	\\
	x^* &= x_k-{f'(x_k)\over f''(x_k)}
	\end{align*}
	In higher dimention this iteration is given by
	\begin{shaded}
	$$x_{n+1} = x_n - [H(x)]^{-1}\nabla f(x_n)$$
	\end{shaded}
	Where $H$ is the hessian matrix
